Small easy to configure temperature nodes using NodeMCU, DHT22, ThingSpeak, and HighCharts.

Again, my new office is too hot or cold.

My friend Gavin (https://github.com/Phrogz) suggested I would collect proof to ask the landlord to fix it, hence this repository.

HW Components:
- NodeMCU
- DHT22

SW Features:
- ThingSpeak
- HighCharts
- Easy node config and WiFi setup without coding
